# LogisticRegressionAppliedToSpeedDating
Our best attempt to apply logistic regression to a Kaggle's dataset about speed dating (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/annavictoria/speed-dating-experiment). Little project for the course "Models and Methods for Statistical Inference", third year of the bachelor degree in Mathematical Engineering at Polimi.

The code is a R notebook (.R_md) that you can open with Rstudio. You can also see our shitty presentation.
